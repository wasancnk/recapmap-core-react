# RecapMap Knowledge Base

**Reorganized**: June 8, 2025  
**Purpose**: Consolidated, minimal knowledge base with essential documentation only

## Overview
This knowledge base contains the core documentation for RecapMap's architecture, design system, development practices, and business vision. All content has been distilled to essential information needed for ongoing development and future team members.

## Knowledge Base Structure

### üìÅ architecture/
Core system architecture and technical specifications:
- **8-node-system.md** - Complete node type definitions and integration patterns
- **technical-decisions.md** - Technology stack and architectural patterns  
- **api-contracts.md** - TypeScript types and backend API contracts

### üìÅ design/
Visual design system and UI architecture:
- **design-system.md** - Color philosophy, node panel architecture, and accessibility standards

### üìÅ development/
Project setup and development guidelines:
- **project-setup.md** - Installation, development workflow, and build process
- **testing-strategy.md** - Testing patterns, coverage requirements, and best practices

### üìÅ vision/
Business strategy and platform vision:
- **platform-overview.md** - Core vision, target users, and business model strategy

### üìÅ archive/
Historical documentation moved from previous unorganized structure:
- **unorganized/** - Original 36 files across 5 categories (preserved for reference)

## Reorganization Summary

### Content Consolidation
- **36 original files** ‚Üí **8 essential documents**
- **5 scattered categories** ‚Üí **4 organized sections**
- **Verbose development logs** ‚Üí **Concise reference documentation**
- **Implementation details** ‚Üí **Strategic architecture focus**

### Key Achievements
‚úÖ **Essential architecture preserved** - 8-node system, technical decisions, API contracts  
‚úÖ **Design system documented** - Color philosophy, panel architecture, accessibility  
‚úÖ **Development guides created** - Setup, testing, and workflow documentation  
‚úÖ **Business vision consolidated** - Platform strategy and user journey essentials  
‚úÖ **Historical content archived** - All original files preserved in archive/  

### Content Focus
- **Production-ready documentation** for ongoing development
- **Future team onboarding** materials for quick understanding
- **Business strategy reference** for vision alignment
- **Technical architecture** for implementation decisions

## Usage Guidelines

### For New Team Members
1. Start with **vision/platform-overview.md** for business context
2. Review **architecture/8-node-system.md** for core system understanding
3. Follow **development/project-setup.md** for technical setup
4. Reference **design/design-system.md** for UI implementation

### For Development
- **architecture/** - Technical implementation decisions and API contracts
- **development/** - Day-to-day development workflow and testing practices
- **design/** - UI consistency and visual standards

### For Strategic Planning
- **vision/** - Business model, user journey, and platform evolution
- **architecture/technical-decisions.md** - Technology migration strategy

### For Historical Reference
- **archive/unorganized/** - Complete development history and detailed implementation logs

## Maintenance Strategy

### Keep Current
- Update architecture documents when core systems change
- Maintain development guides as workflow evolves
- Refresh vision documents for strategic pivots

### Archive Pattern
- Move detailed implementation logs to archive/
- Preserve business context and architectural decisions
- Focus on essential information for ongoing work

## Document Standards

### Content Principles
- **Concise**: Essential information only, no implementation noise
- **Actionable**: Practical guidance for development and decisions
- **Current**: Reflects production architecture and active practices
- **Complete**: All necessary context for understanding and implementation

### Format Guidelines
- **Markdown**: Consistent formatting and structure
- **Code Examples**: TypeScript/React patterns with proper syntax
- **Clear Headings**: Scannable document structure
- **Update Dates**: Track document freshness
