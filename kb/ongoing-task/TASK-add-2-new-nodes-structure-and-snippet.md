# Adding 2 New Nodes: Structure and Snippet

**Date**: July 3, 2025  
**Status**: Concept Design and Implementation Planning  
**Priority**: Medium - Feature Enhancement  

## Overview

This document outlines the concept, design, and implementation plan for adding two new node types to the RecapMap system: **Structure** and **Snippet** nodes. These nodes bridge the gap between semantic business intention and executable code implementation, evolving the system from 12 to 14 nodes.

## Node Concepts

### üîß 13. Structure Node

**Purpose**: Represents structural logic blocks like classes, functions, conditions, loops, and other code architecture elements.

**Role in the System**:
- Acts as the semantic skeleton of executable logic
- Allows mapping between abstract process flow and real code structure  
- Creates an intermediate layer between "semantic intention" and "code reality"
- Crucial for interpretation, regeneration, and debugging in explainable AI systems

**Why It's Important**:
- Bridges the abstract-to-concrete divide essential for AI-assisted development
- Makes AI-generated code more interpretable and maintainable
- Enables structured approach to code generation from business logic
- Provides architectural guidance for complex application development

### üß© 14. Snippet Node

**Purpose**: Represents reusable code snippets or logic fragments, labeled and referenced by name.

**Examples**:
- `sanitizeInput()`
- `calculateRoute()`  
- `getUserData()`
- `validateEmail()`
- `formatCurrency()`

**Role in the System**:
- Links modular logic directly with process or task nodes
- Implements DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by pointing to canonical logic references
- Enables composability and version control of logical actions
- Provides reusable building blocks for complex functionality

**Why It's Important**:
- Eliminates code duplication across the system
- Enables building complex logic from simpler, tested pieces
- Supports version control and maintenance of code components
- Essential for capability nodes that rely on shared or previously defined logic

## System Integration

### Current 12-Node System Evolution

**From Business Intent to Code Implementation**:
```
Business Layer:     usecase ‚Üí expectation ‚Üí outcome
Human Interface:    presentation ‚Üí persona ‚Üí screen  
Business Logic:     process ‚Üí task
Information:        resource ‚Üí knowledge ‚Üí storage
Collaboration:      note
NEW Code Layer:     structure ‚Üí snippet
```

### Workflow Integration

**Typical Development Flow**:
1. **Business Intent** (usecase, expectation nodes)
2. **User Interface Design** (screen, presentation nodes)  
3. **Business Logic Definition** (process, task nodes)
4. **Code Architecture** (structure nodes) ‚Üê **NEW**
5. **Reusable Components** (snippet nodes) ‚Üê **NEW**
6. **Data Management** (storage, resource nodes)

### Node Relationships
