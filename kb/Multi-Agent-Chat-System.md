# Multi-Agent Chat System Architecture

**Date**: May 31, 2025  
**Project**: RecapMap - Visual AGI Orchestration Platform  
**Component**: Distributed AI Collaboration System

## Overview

The Multi-Agent Chat System is a core component of RecapMap that enables distributed AI collaboration through node-scoped conversations, strategic timeline trees, and real-time multi-user coordination. This system transforms traditional chat into a visual thinking platform where AI agents collaborate on business logic design.

## Conclusion

The Multi-Agent Chat System transforms RecapMap from a visual design tool into an intelligent collaborative platform. By combining human creativity with AI expertise, we create a system where business logic design becomes a guided, strategic conversation rather than a solitary struggle with complexity.

This system ensures that every decision is well-reasoned, every alternative is considered, and all knowledge is captured for future reuse. The result is not just faster development, but better decisions and more maintainable systems.
