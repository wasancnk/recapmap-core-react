# Platform Vision Overview

**Last Updated**: June 8, 2025  
**Purpose**: Core vision and business strategy for RecapMap

## Executive Summary

RecapMap is a **visual AGI orchestration platform** that democratizes software development by transforming visual business thinking into deployable applications through AI-assisted code generation.

## Core Vision Statement

> "Think once, run anywhere" - A platform that transforms visual business logic into deployable applications through AI-assisted code generation.

## The Platform Concept

### Visual AGI Orchestration
- **Visual Design**: Business logic designed through intuitive 8-node mindmap interface
- **AI Translation**: Visual designs converted to structured YAML task descriptions
- **Code Generation**: AI agents generate complete applications from specifications
- **Universal Deployment**: Generated apps run anywhere (web, mobile, desktop)

### Meta-Platform Architecture
Not just another low-code tool - it's a **platform to build platforms**:
- Structured flexibility through rigid 8-node architecture
- Unlimited business applications through controlled components
- Like Google Firebase + n8n combined with visual design

## Target Users

### Primary Users
1. **VC CEOs**: Non-technical visionaries who need to communicate business ideas
2. **Business Analysts**: Bridge between business and technical teams  
3. **Developers**: Technical implementers who want 10x faster development
4. **Enterprise Teams**: Organizations needing rapid prototyping and deployment

### User Experience Flow
```
Business Vision → Chat with AI Agent → Visual Flow Generation → 
User Refinement → AI Code Generation → Deployed Application
```

### Detailed User Journey
1. **Initial Chat**: User chats with AI agent about business requirements
2. **AI Interpretation**: Agent converts conversation to YAML specifications
3. **Visual Generation**: YAML parsed into 8-node mindmap representation
4. **Collaborative Refinement**: User clicks nodes, adjusts properties, refines with AI
5. **Context Enrichment**: Multi-agent chat system provides specialized expertise
6. **Final Generation**: Refined node data becomes perfect AI task description
7. **Application Creation**: AI generates React components and Java backend logic

## Platform Modes

### 1. Builder Mode (Desktop-First)
- **Visual Workspace**: Node-based design with 8-node system
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multi-user editing with conflict resolution
- **Property Management**: Floating panels for detailed node configuration
- **Multi-Agent Chat**: Distributed AI assistance across workflow design

### 2. Assistant Mode (Mobile-Friendly)
- **ChatGPT-like Interface**: Natural language interaction
- **App Summoning**: Type keywords to launch created applications
- **Quick Creation**: Voice-to-visual workflow generation
- **Context Switching**: Seamless transition to Builder mode

## Business Model Strategy

### Marketplace Ecosystem
- **Template Marketplace**: Industry-specific workflow templates
- **Certified Blueprints**: "Ready-to-bootstrap business" complete solutions
- **Partnership Revenue**: Up to 50% revenue sharing with capability contributors
- **Franchise Model**: Template adoption = complete business setup

### Capability Platform
- **Pre-Built Functions**: Only certified Java capabilities for security
- **API Integration**: Connect to external services (n8n, Make, APIs)
- **Capability Absorption**: Gradually internalize popular external dependencies
- **Custom Requests**: Users can request new capabilities for development

### Commercialization Path
- **Freemium Model**: Basic platform free, advanced features paid
- **Enterprise Licensing**: Private deployments and custom capabilities
- **Marketplace Commission**: Revenue share from template and capability sales
- **Professional Services**: Custom template development and integration

## Technical Vision

### Architecture Philosophy
- **Zone 1**: Builder Robot (React Frontend + Java Backend)
- **Zone 2**: Generated Applications (AI-created business logic)
- **Controlled Flexibility**: Unlimited possibilities through structured 8-node constraints

### Quality Standards
- **Production-Ready**: Not prototypes - commercializable from day one
- **Scalable Architecture**: Multi-tenant ready, real-time collaboration
- **Security-First**: All capabilities pre-built and security-audited
- **Performance-Optimized**: 200+ node capacity, Unity/WebGL future migration

### AI Integration Strategy
- **Perfect Task Descriptions**: YAML optimized for AI comprehension
- **Multi-Agent Expertise**: Specialized AI agents for different domains
- **Context-Aware Generation**: Visual node relationships inform AI decisions
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement through user feedback
