# Lean Development Strategy: Security-First Minimal Dependencies

**Date**: May 31, 2025  
**Project**: RecapMap - Visual AGI Orchestration Platform  
**Component**: Updated Development Strategy with Unity Migration Path

## Overview

This document outlines our **lean, security-first development strategy** based on the insights that:
1. **Frontend bloat is a real security risk** (1300+ npm packages create massive attack surface)
2. **Java backend provides enterprise-grade security** and IP protection
3. **Unity migration is the long-term vision** for native performance and consolidated architecture
4. **Minimal dependencies** enable faster Unity porting and reduced security risks

## Core Philosophy

### Zero-Trust Frontend Architecture
```yaml
security_principles:
  frontend_role: "Presentation layer only - never trusted"
  backend_fortress: "Java Spring Boot as primary defense line"
  
  zero_trust_rules:
    - "All business logic validation in Java backend"
    - "YAML generation algorithms protected server-side"
    - "Authentication and authorization in Java only"
    - "Database access through Java APIs only"
    - "Node validation and business rules server-side"

ip_protection_strategy:
  core_algorithms: "YAML generation and AI orchestration in Java"
  frontend_limits: "Visual manipulation and user interaction only"
  security_boundary: "API requests validated and authorized in Java"
```

### Minimal Dependencies Strategy
```yaml
dependency_philosophy:
  phase_1a_packages: "Maximum 5 npm packages"
  rationale:
    - "Smaller attack surface for security auditing"
    - "Faster installation and build times"  
    - "Easier Unity migration with less external dependencies"
    - "Reduced supply chain security risks"
    - "Cleaner architecture with fewer abstractions"

package_selection_criteria:
  essential_only: "Only packages that are absolutely unavoidable"
  security_reviewed: "Well-maintained packages with good security track record"
  migration_friendly: "Concepts that translate well to Unity C#"
  minimal_footprint: "Small bundle size and minimal transitive dependencies"
```

## Phase 1A: Minimal Viable Canvas (Weeks 1-2)

### Essential Dependencies Only
```bash
# Core Visual Canvas (unavoidable)
npm install @xyflow/react

# Lightweight State Management  
npm install zustand

# Utility-First Styling
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

# Essential Utilities
npm install clsx uuid
```

**Total: 5 packages** (vs 20+ in typical React projects)

## Phase 1B: Lean Feature Development (Weeks 3-6)

### Add Features Only When Blocked
```yaml
incremental_approach:

defer_until_needed:
  advanced_animations: "CSS transitions vs framer-motion"
  rich_icons: "SVG sprites vs lucide-react"
  complex_forms: "Custom components vs form libraries"
  testing_frameworks: "Add when component library stabilizes"

evaluation_checkpoints:
  - "After each feature, evaluate if additional packages are truly needed"
  - "Consider Unity migration impact before adding new dependencies"
  - "Prioritize custom implementation over external libraries"
  - "Document dependency decisions and alternatives considered"
```
