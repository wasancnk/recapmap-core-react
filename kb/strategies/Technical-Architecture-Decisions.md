## Overview

This document captures the key technical architecture decisions for RecapMap, including technology stack selection, architectural patterns, integration strategies, and scalability considerations. These decisions prioritize production readiness, maintainability, and enterprise scalability.

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend Architecture Strategy

#### Lean Dependency Philosophy
```yaml
dependency_strategy: "Minimal packages with Unity migration path"
rationale:
  security_first:
    - "Fewer npm packages = smaller attack surface"
    - "Zero trust frontend with Java backend as defense line"
    - "Business logic and YAML generation protected server-side"
    - "Frontend as presentation layer only"
  
  migration_readiness:
    - "React as proof-of-concept and rapid prototyping"
    - "Unity as target platform for production deployment"
    - "Lean codebase easier to port to Unity C#"
    - "Minimal external dependencies reduce migration complexity"

  architectural_clarity:
    - "Users describe business requirements, not technical implementation"
    - "React is RecapMap's rendering engine, not user choice"
    - "No framework selection fields - platform decision, not user decision"
    - "AI handles all technical translation from business requirements to code"

phase_strategy:
  phase_1a: "React MVP with 5 core packages only"
  phase_1b: "Java backend integration (secure foundation)"
  phase_2: "Unity frontend + Java backend (production)"
  
evolution_path:
  current: "React for rapid validation and enterprise demos"
  target: "Unity for native performance and consolidated architecture"
  benefits: "Professional visual tools, single codebase, no npm bloat"

confidence_level: 0.95
decision_date: "2025-05-31"
```

#### React + TypeScript Selection (Interim Solution)
```yaml
decision: "React 18+ with TypeScript 5+ as stepping stone to Unity"
rationale:
  short_term_benefits:
    - "Rapid prototyping and concept validation"
    - "Quick enterprise demos and investor presentations"
    - "Familiar technology for initial development team"
    - "Web-based accessibility for early user testing"
  
  migration_advantages:
    - "TypeScript patterns translate well to C# in Unity"
    - "Component-based architecture maps to Unity prefabs"
    - "State management concepts apply to Unity ScriptableObjects"
    - "Business logic already separated in Java backend"

  architectural_consistency:
    - "Framework selection removed from ScreenNode interface"
    - "Users focus on business requirements, not implementation"
    - "React is the platform choice, not user choice"
    - "Clean separation between business logic and technical implementation"

alternatives_considered:
  direct_unity: "Slower initial development, harder to demo web-based concepts"
  vue_angular: "Additional learning curve with no Unity migration benefits"
  native_desktop: "Platform-specific development, limits reach"

confidence_level: 0.85
temporary_solution: true
migration_target: "Unity 2025+"
```

### Minimal Dependencies Strategy

#### Core Package Selection (Phase 1A)
```yaml
essential_packages:
  visual_canvas:
    package: "@xyflow/react"
    purpose: "Node-based visual editor (core requirement)"
    rationale: "Industry standard, unavoidable for mindmap functionality"
    risk_level: "acceptable - core platform dependency"
  
  state_management:
    package: "zustand"
    purpose: "Lightweight global state (vs Redux complexity)"
    rationale: "Minimal API, TypeScript-first, small bundle"
    migration_note: "State patterns translate well to Unity ScriptableObjects"
  
  styling_foundation:
    package: "tailwindcss + postcss + autoprefixer"
    purpose: "Utility-first CSS system"
    rationale: "Replaces multiple CSS libraries, purged output"
    migration_note: "CSS concepts translate to Unity UI styling"
  
  utilities:
    packages: ["clsx", "uuid"]
    purpose: "Class management and unique ID generation"
    rationale: "Tiny utilities, essential functionality"
    
total_additional_packages: 5
npm_bloat_prevention: "No speculative dependencies - add only when blocked"
```

#### Deferred Dependencies (Add Only When Needed)
```yaml
deferred_until_specific_need:
  ui_components: "Build custom vs @radix-ui/* initially"
  animations: "CSS transitions vs framer-motion initially"
  icons: "SVG sprites vs lucide-react initially"
  validation: "Manual checks vs zod initially"
  testing: "Add when component library grows"

security_benefits:
  - "Smaller attack surface with fewer packages"
  - "Easier security auditing and updates"
  - "Reduced supply chain risks"
  - "Faster installation and build times"

unity_migration_benefits:
  - "Less code to port from React to Unity"
  - "Fewer external concepts to translate"
  - "Cleaner architecture for C# implementation"
```

## Component Architecture Patterns

### Atomic Design Principles

#### Component Hierarchy
```yaml
design_system_organization:
  atoms:
    purpose: "Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs, icons)"
    examples: ["Button", "Input", "Icon", "Badge", "Tooltip"]
    rules: "No business logic, only presentation"
  
  molecules:
    purpose: "Simple combinations of atoms"
    examples: ["SearchInput", "PropertyField", "ChatMessage", "NodeHandle"]
    rules: "Single responsibility, reusable across contexts"
  
  organisms:
    purpose: "Complex components with business logic"
    examples: ["NodeEditor", "ChatPanel", "PropertyPanel", "Toolbar"]
    rules: "Can contain state, connect to stores"
  
  templates:
    purpose: "Page layouts and structure"
    examples: ["DashboardLayout", "CollaborationLayout"]
    rules: "Define layout patterns, no specific content"
  
  pages:
    purpose: "Specific application screens"
    examples: ["ProjectDashboard", "MindmapEditor", "UserSettings"]
    rules: "Compose templates with real data"
```

#### File Organization
```typescript
// Enforced directory structure
