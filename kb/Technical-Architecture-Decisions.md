## Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend Architecture Strategy

#### Lean Dependency Philosophy
```yaml
dependency_strategy: "Minimal packages with Unity migration path"
rationale:
  security_first:
    - "Fewer npm packages = smaller attack surface"
    - "Zero trust frontend with Java backend as defense line"
    - "Business logic and YAML generation protected server-side"
    - "Frontend as presentation layer only"
  
  migration_readiness:
    - "React as proof-of-concept and rapid prototyping"
    - "Unity as target platform for production deployment"
    - "Lean codebase easier to port to Unity C#"
    - "Minimal external dependencies reduce migration complexity"

phase_strategy:
  phase_1a: "React MVP with 5 core packages only"
  phase_1b: "Java backend integration (secure foundation)"
  phase_2: "Unity frontend + Java backend (production)"
  
evolution_path:
  current: "React for rapid validation and enterprise demos"
  target: "Unity for native performance and consolidated architecture"
  benefits: "Professional visual tools, single codebase, no npm bloat"

confidence_level: 0.95
decision_date: "2025-05-31"
```

#### React + TypeScript Selection (Interim Solution)
```yaml
decision: "React 18+ with TypeScript 5+ as stepping stone to Unity"
rationale:
  short_term_benefits:
    - "Rapid prototyping and concept validation"
    - "Quick enterprise demos and investor presentations"
    - "Familiar technology for initial development team"
    - "Web-based accessibility for early user testing"
  
  migration_advantages:
    - "TypeScript patterns translate well to C# in Unity"
    - "Component-based architecture maps to Unity prefabs"
    - "State management concepts apply to Unity ScriptableObjects"
    - "Business logic already separated in Java backend"

alternatives_considered:
  direct_unity: "Slower initial development, harder to demo web-based concepts"
  vue_angular: "Additional learning curve with no Unity migration benefits"
  native_desktop: "Platform-specific development, limits reach"

confidence_level: 0.85
temporary_solution: true
migration_target: "Unity 2025+"
```

### Minimal Dependencies Strategy

#### Core Package Selection (Phase 1A)
```yaml
essential_packages:
  visual_canvas:
    package: "@xyflow/react"
    purpose: "Node-based visual editor (core requirement)"
    rationale: "Industry standard, unavoidable for mindmap functionality"
    risk_level: "acceptable - core platform dependency"
  
  state_management:
    package: "zustand"
    purpose: "Lightweight global state (vs Redux complexity)"
    rationale: "Minimal API, TypeScript-first, small bundle"
    migration_note: "State patterns translate well to Unity ScriptableObjects"
  
  styling_foundation:
    package: "tailwindcss + postcss + autoprefixer"
    purpose: "Utility-first CSS system"
    rationale: "Replaces multiple CSS libraries, purged output"
    migration_note: "CSS concepts translate to Unity UI styling"
  
  utilities:
    packages: ["clsx", "uuid"]
    purpose: "Class management and unique ID generation"
    rationale: "Tiny utilities, essential functionality"
    
total_additional_packages: 5
npm_bloat_prevention: "No speculative dependencies - add only when blocked"
```

#### Deferred Dependencies (Add Only When Needed)
```yaml
deferred_until_specific_need:
  ui_components: "Build custom vs @radix-ui/* initially"
  animations: "CSS transitions vs framer-motion initially"
  icons: "SVG sprites vs lucide-react initially"
  validation: "Manual checks vs zod initially"
  testing: "Add when component library grows"

security_benefits:
  - "Smaller attack surface with fewer packages"
  - "Easier security auditing and updates"
  - "Reduced supply chain risks"
  - "Faster installation and build times"

unity_migration_benefits:
  - "Less code to port from React to Unity"
  - "Fewer external concepts to translate"
  - "Cleaner architecture for C# implementation"
```

  customization:
    - "Easy to create custom design system"
    - "Component composition without style overhead"
    - "Responsive design utilities built-in"
  
  maintenance:
    - "Purged CSS removes unused styles automatically"
    - "No orphaned CSS when components are removed"
    - "Version updates don't break existing styles"

alternatives_considered:
  styled_components: "Runtime overhead and CSS-in-JS complexity"
  emotion: "Good but prefer utility-first approach"
  plain_css: "Would require significant architecture for consistency"
  chakra_ui: "Component library would limit visual customization"

confidence_level: 0.9
```

## Component Architecture Patterns

### Atomic Design Principles

#### Component Hierarchy
```yaml
design_system_organization:
  atoms:
    purpose: "Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs, icons)"
    examples: ["Button", "Input", "Icon", "Badge", "Tooltip"]
    rules: "No business logic, only presentation"
  
  molecules:
    purpose: "Simple combinations of atoms"
    examples: ["SearchInput", "PropertyField", "ChatMessage", "NodeHandle"]
    rules: "Single responsibility, reusable across contexts"
  
  organisms:
    purpose: "Complex components with business logic"
    examples: ["NodeEditor", "ChatPanel", "PropertyPanel", "Toolbar"]
    rules: "Can contain state, connect to stores"
  
  templates:
    purpose: "Page layouts and structure"
    examples: ["DashboardLayout", "CollaborationLayout"]
    rules: "Define layout patterns, no specific content"
  
  pages:
    purpose: "Specific application screens"
    examples: ["ProjectDashboard", "MindmapEditor", "UserSettings"]
    rules: "Compose templates with real data"
```

#### File Organization
```typescript
